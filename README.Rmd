`dopingdata` contains data from the [United States Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Anti-Doping_Agency) for exploration, modeling, and visualizations. The datasets in this package are derived from from the [USADA website](https://www.usada.org/) and the [World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned substances list](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list?q=). Scraping, processing, and visualizing these data presented so many unique challenges I decided to combine the utilities into a package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `dopingdata` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjfrigaard/dopingdata")
```

```{r}
library(dopingdata)
```
